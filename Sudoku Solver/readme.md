# Sudoku Solver
This project is meant for searching and reveal a solution
for a sudoku puzzle. 

For using this project u need a C++ compiler(GCC).
1. After doing a copy-paste from MainSudoku.cpp u can run it.
2. In sudoku.in file u need to paste the puzzle
Some rules for pasting the puzzle in sudoku.in file is that 0 is considered that beeing NULL
I will do an example here:
This is a random sudoku puzzle site that give me the key
![sudoku_puzzle](https://github.com/Leonard1403/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Sudoku%20Solver/images/test.png)
and this is how u need to paste on the file
![sudoku.in](https://github.com/Leonard1403/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Sudoku%20Solver/images/in.png)
3. After all this steps, u can run the code and the console will show up with the answers. U can check also the sudoku.out file for the solution
![sudoku.out](https://github.com/Leonard1403/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Sudoku%20Solver/images/out.png)
![sudoku.out_console](https://github.com/Leonard1403/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Sudoku%20Solver/images/solution.png)
